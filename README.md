## Purpose of This Repository

This repository serves as a **living overview** of my analytics, BI, and data platform journey at ECO3.

I am currently working in this role, and this repository will evolve over time as:
- New projects are delivered
- New repositories are created
- The data platform matures

Rather than a single project, this repository acts as:
- A navigation hub
- A career timeline
- A high-level architectural and ownership overview

---

## Role Context

**Role:** Business Data Analyst  
**Company:** ECO3  
**Period:** June 2025 – Present (Ongoing)

I joined ECO3 in an environment with **no formal documentation, onboarding, or ownership clarity** around the existing data landscape.

Before improvements could be made, the entire ecosystem had to be understood, stabilized, and re-imagined.

---

## High-Level Journey Overview

My work at ECO3 can be grouped into four major phases:

1. Legacy environment discovery & risk assessment  
2. Operational BI ownership & trust restoration  
3. Data engineering & automation  
4. Future-state platform design (BDM 2.0)

Each phase builds on the previous one and is documented through dedicated repositories.
